I created this GitHub account for Web Program Database Foundation Class.
I created a repository for the class above, made slight changes by adding a new folder, opening in IntelliJ, then pushing the changes.
I cloned the repository by using the GitHub desktop application by selecting to clone from my list of repositories, the cloned repository is in my GitHub folder under Documents.
